 ## Description
This is a web app developed to create notes in a database for later use.
 ## Installation
 This app is deployed on heroku but to use the code you must have node js installed and then npm i the packages from the root folder for this to work locally.
## Usage
Anyone who would need to keep track of notes with no ads could use this app. This app is currently still in development and I am working on issues to fix the code that puts the notes into a readable format after submitting them
